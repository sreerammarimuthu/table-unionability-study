# Table-Unionability-Study

Welcome to the companion repository for our research paper titled:

“Humans, Machine Learning, and Language Models in Union: A Cognitive Study on Table Unionability” 
#### Status Update: Accepted at ACM SIGMOD HILDA 2025

This repository provides open access to selected data samples, feature annotations, and supporting materials used in our research study. The research explores how human cognition, machine learning models, and large language models (LLMs) interact when determining the unionability of relational tables, highlighting both interpretability and performance trade-offs in Human-in-the-loop systems.

Contents:
- Data Samples used in the study
- Feature descriptions and engineering logic
- Visual and tabular results included in the paper

We hope this work supports future studies at the intersection of human-in-the-loop AI, data discovery, and LLM interpretability. 

### Note: This paper presents a summary of our preliminary results from analysis, and we aim to expand this research further in future work.
